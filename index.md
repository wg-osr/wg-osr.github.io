## Welcome to WACK 
Here lies my personal Knave hack <br>
Still very much so a WIP 

The core rules system comes from Knave (and its many *other* hacks) as well as... <br>
- GLOG's magic die system
- "Classless" characters but possible options for lineages, backgrounds, or something else
- Ancestry instead of Race
- Mork Borg's "Calender of Nechrubel"
