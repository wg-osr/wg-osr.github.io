  - Put them on the backfoot, granting you Advantage on your next attack or stunt
- **Great Weapon Fighter** - When wielding a two-handed weapon, reroll damage dice on a roll of 3 or less. Keep the second result.
- **Protector** - Sacrifice your Action to absorb damage inflicted on an adjacent ally. STR check for half-damage.
- **Riposte** - When a creature misses you with a melee attack, make an immediate counter-attack. This does not cost you your normal Action. Only possible once per round.
- **Shield Master**
  - Advantage on STR attempts to knock an opponent prone with a shield bash
  - When an effect allows a DEX check for half-damage, take no damage if you succeed as your shield absorbs the blow (-1 quality to shield)
