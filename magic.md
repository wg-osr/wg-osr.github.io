Spells are cast out of spell books, which must be held in both hands and read aloud. Each spell books only holds a single spell, and each spell book takes up an item slot.

In order to reliably cast spells a PC must take the Student of the Arcane Knack. 
<br>
Instead of having a set number of spells that can be cast each day, a PC has a certain amount of **Magic Dice** (MD).

- **Magic Dice** (d6)
  - After choosing a spell to cast, choose how many MD you want to invest, then roll the dice
  - Every die that returns a 1-3 returns to your MD pool
  - Every die that returns a 4-6 is exhausted and only returns to you MD pool after a good night's sleep.
  - Once your MD pool is empty you cannot cast any more spells that day.
  - The more MD you roll, the more powerful the spell.
  - *However*, the more MD you roll, the greater the chance for mishaps and catastrophes
  - **Doubles:** Arcance Mishap
  - **Triples:** Arcane Catastrophe

**Student of the Arcane:** You have a number of Magic Dice equal to your [level]/2 (rounded up).
