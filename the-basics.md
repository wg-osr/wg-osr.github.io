## Abilities
Player Characters (PCs) have six abilities.
* **Strength** (STR): Used for melee attacks and checks requiring physical power, e.g. lifting gates, bending bars.
* **Dexterity** (DEX): Used for checks requiring poise, speed, and reflexes, like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc. PCs also have "handy slots" equal to DEX

* **Intelligence** (INT): Used for checks requiring cleverness like deciphering spellbooks, crafting objects, etc.
* **Wisdom** (WIS): Used for ranged attacks and checks requiring focus and willpower, like tracking foes. 
* **Charisma** (CHA): Used for checks to influence NPCs, contact spirits, win initiative, call down miracles, or break enemy morale. A PC can have a number of followers equal to CHA


## Actions
When a PC takes an action, consider the following:
- **Is the outcome of the action obvious?** Most actions either automatically succeed or automatically fail. Use common sense.
- **Does the task require specialized training?** If so, the PC must have a related background in order to attempt it.
