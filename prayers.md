# Prayers
Clerics, priest, paladins, zealots, and holy individuals fuel their powers by **saying Prayers** to their deity, god(s), or authority. 
More reliable than an arcane wizard could ever dream of, faith-based magic does not require the use of Magic Dice. A PC that has taken a sacred oath,
and taken the **Blind Faith** Knack, is able to use **Clerical Implements** (CI). These take the form of bells, candles, herbs, or any other similar tools
and are the fuel of these divine Prayers.

### Clerical Implements
Rare and obscure items. They cannot be crafted or bought, but could be traded, found, or scaveneged. To a fellow priest or scholar they are invaluable.
To most peasants, useless trinkets. <br>
**Saying a Prayer requires an Action (unless otherwise specified), and the CI held in one hand.** The rest of the CI can easily in the backpack and still
be serviceable.
